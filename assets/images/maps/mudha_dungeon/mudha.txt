Story

Cali, the one who placed a curse on Biryu Castle returns once again to wreak havoc on the world of Tantra.

Mudha

After Vishnu sealed Shiva in the Mudha Dungeon for murdering Brahma, Cali wrought havoc and shattered the peace and order of Biryu. All over the world it rained blood and she disappeared.

Now Cali is back and wants to free Shiva, and destroy Vishnu. Feeding on the blood and souls of the Mara, now she is more powerful. No one can defeat Cali.

The Eight Gods have already lost their souls to her; they are now just Cali's slaves.
