					    <p>The strapping and gregarious Naga dwell on the pristine islands surrounded by the majestic waters of the Aegean Sea. Their habitation is located at the western part of Rameswaram, considered the sacred ground of the south.</p>

						<p>The Nagas are fishermen by profession. They hop from island to island in search of new discoveries. Wielding their mighty broadswords, they are universally hailed as the strongest among all the tribes. One swing from their sword and a small boat is sliced into two.</p>

						<p>Their humongous physique makes them easy prey on land as they are horrendously slow. To compensate for this, they resort to wearing heavy armor as added protection. Relying heavily on their superhuman strength, they shun the use of any form of Mantra whatsoever.</p>

						<p>One fell swoop from a Naga’s sword is always a losing proposition.</p>

They hawk their trade in the most extreme of natural environments and are usually aided by female warriors. This hardy race can be found living in the desert portion of the far end of the west continent.</p>
					    <p>The Kimnaras are female warriors who are highly-attuned to the ancient discipline of chakra, the art of enhancing physical prowess. They are held in the same league as the Naga tribe in terms of bodily strength.</p>
						<p>Extremely powerful and clad in solid armor, they are a force to reckon with in combat. However, their brutish physique slows them down and they are defenseless from magic attacks.</p>
						<p>Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned so be twice as kind to the Kimnaras.</p>

					    <p>Highly skilled in deciphering ancient verses of the gods, they uphold this archaic tradition by recording them in special slates and inscribe these writings on their bodies which they proudly display as an exquisite body art.</p>
						<p>Compared to other tribes, they avoid covering the word of the god making them vulnerable to physical attacks but this only compensates for their extraordinary magical powers and high resistance from Mantra Magic.</p>

						<p>Garudas are similar to Devas when it comes to countering other Mantra attacks and they can use it to improve its power and effects to their advantage, they can also produce Mantra-enhanced tools for other tribes. But like Devas, they are also physically weak.</p>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 tribe-info">
					<p>While its true there are 8 tribes, they've been paired up being: Naga / Kimnara, Yaksa / Gandharva, Asura / Rakshasa, Deva / Garuda. Each has the same skills regardless of their gender. They can specialize on either support or attack role upon reaching level 45 with Second Job quest.</p>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 tribe-info">
					<p>The strongest race in Tantra basically depends on the progression since in each stage one is stronger than the other according to the progress which finally gets balanced at the maximum level, so we can give you a guide:</p>
					<ul class="list-group ml-3">
						<li>Level 1 - 50 : The strongest race is Deva/Garuda because they do not require being close to the enemy or having contact with monsters, with all the chakra points in mental they can level up quickly.</li>
						<li>Level 50 - 80: The strongest race is Asura/Rakshasa, having explosive attacks and fast speed allowing you to easily go in and out of combat.</li>
						<li>Level 80 - 100: The strongest race is the Yaksa Gandharva because it already has powerful buffs and attack skills like Chamuse and Saata.</li>
						<li>Level 100 - 110: The most powerful race is the Naga/Kimnara, with a powerful Amara skill "Badra" as its most effective weapon. However, it is weak against magical powers.</li>
						<li>Level 110 - 120: All races are equally powerful and will depend on skill and party to succeed.</li>
