					<h3 class="text-center">Preface</h3>
						<p class="mt-3">From the ancient world of the Trimutri, gods and humans were living together in perfect harmony. TANTRA was created - the almost perfect haven among the native nations, but this temporary peace is destined to be disrupted by a malevolence that has shown itself to the open.</p>

					<h3 class="text-center">Haima Yuga: The Golden Age</h3>
						<p class="mt-3">A time of peace between gods and humans living together, this era was known as the Haima Yuga - the time when the 3 gods, Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva are living as one at the Shambala Castle. They are the rulers of Tantra that brings the balance to its tranquility.</p>
						<p>After a long, long time of peace and serenity, humans began to envy the gods making them anxious about themselves, creating curiosity about all the things and its purpose resulting to their disbelief to the gods. The supremacy of the gods provoked a deep envy among humans. </p>
						<p>As it happens, they fled on to their separate ways making the 8 tribes shape the world.</p>
						<p>As the humans go on, their path is still guided by the gods. Oracles are found with each tribe communicating with the gods. As the realms of tantra slowly taking into shape, a vision of both humankind and gods was now possible and has came to reality.</p>

					<h3 class="text-center">The Fatality of Brahma</h3>
						<p class="mt-3">Life as it is known seem peaceful and quiet in the realms of Tantra but the destiny had to take place. Evil to arise when Shiva the destroyer, slit the throat of Brahma.</p>
						<p>This act resulted to imbalance within Tantra. </p>
						<p>Few brave warriors among humans tried to bring back the lost balance to its place by closing the gates of Shambala. It was foretold that this was going to happen, that a horrifying evil shall cross its path to the land. The disappearance of the gods and the closure of the gate of Shambala made the forces of evil much stronger.</p>
						<p>Mara's evil plan was like a reigning cloud over the land, eradicating the gate keepers and leaving the humankind to rely on their defenseless selves.</p>

					<h3 class="text-center">Memories of the Eight Kings</h3>
						<p class="mt-3">Life as it is known seem peaceful and quiet in the realms of Tantra but the destiny had to take place. Evil to arise when Shiva the destroyer, slit the throat of Brahma.</p>
						<p>As the Mara's minions take down the gatekeepers' defense, humans from the eight tribes united to fight Mara's evil scheme. Each tribe was headed by eight noble heroes who lead them into the war. The battle between the heroes and Mara's dark army lasted for 1 yogi (10 years) resulting to massive casualties.</p>
						<p>Mara and its followers initiate a final strike but eventually repulsed by the brave humans sealing Mara to its due place away from Tantra. The battle ended in humankinds' favor but the victory was replaced by the lives of the 8 warriors as sacrifice to win the war. Moreover, as a tribute to the great warriors, humans gave a rightful place for the heroes. They renamed them as the 8 kings and their legend was passed on to generations.</p>
						<p>As time passed by, it slowly erased the memories of the battle and the 8 kings from the minds of the newer generation.</p>

					<h3 class="text-center">Epoch of the Dark Age</h3>
						<p class="mt-3">7 yogi (70 years) passed and the humankind were slowly getting their strength back from the result of the great battle. New cities were develop in a once desolated land. They named one of the cities Mantra Plava, a city where the descendants from the 8 tribes lived together in peace and order.</p>
						<p>After the unexpected disappearance of the three gods, it left a gap between humans. Many questions were unanswered, questions that would give them enlightenment with the truth and strong beliefs. Their ideas  collide with one another causing separate beliefs.</p>
						<p>At this time of uncertainty, the delicate peace and harmony was about to be broken. A rumor about the sightings of the evil creatures was believed as a descendants of Mara also known as Mara's Blood spread through the fearful humans.</p>
						<p>Upon the increasing number of the known evil, humans evacuated Mantra Plava and headed south to begin constructing shelters and defenses from Mara's blood. Still, lives are being paid on and several attempts were undertaken on the evils den it but failed to stop the threats.</p>
						<p>Attempting to do what the eight kings have done for the humans, the brave ones are powerless against the massive power of Mara's blood. The time of tranquility, that once ruled for a great time has ended.</p>
						<p>A new and more ferocious evil has now come to the open. The Dark Age has come, a time of terror and evil.</p>
